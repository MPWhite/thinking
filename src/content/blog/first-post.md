I recently purchased an iPad so I could read and annotate PDFs in bed without needing to bring my laptop or phone into the bedroom. 

Overall I've found the device to be pretty good. I don't have many apps installed on it other than Zotero and Audible, both of which I'd recommend. 

One thing that I've found mind-bendingly bad, however, are the volume buttons. This may come as a shock, given that physical volume buttons have been a solved design problem since at least the Zenith “Space Command” television remote in the 1950s. 

If aren't familiar with the design of the modern iPad volume controls, let me take a moment to explain. Consider an arbitrary rectangular touch-screen device.
