# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! This blog is built with:

- **Astro** - A modern static site generator
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe code
- **Markdown** - For writing content

## How It Works

Simply create markdown files in `src/content/blog/` with frontmatter containing:
- `title` - The post title
- `description` - A short description
- `date` - Publication date
- `draft` (optional) - Set to `true` to hide from the blog listing

Write your content below the frontmatter using standard Markdown syntax.

## Publishing

After creating or editing posts, build the site and deploy to your hosting provider.
